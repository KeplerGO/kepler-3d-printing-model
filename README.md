# Kepler 3D-Printable Lego Model

The Kepler Mission, NASA Discovery mission #10,
is specifically designed to survey a portion of 
our region of the Milky Way galaxy to discover 
dozens of Earth-size planets in or near the 
habitable zone and determine how many of the 
billions of stars in our galaxy have such planets.

Printable files are of Kepler spacecraft in constructable configuration. 
This model was created for educational purposes, and as such files are scaled for durability where appropriate.

Recommended print settings:
-Solid print density
-Soluble support structure
-Existing file orientation (printer varying)

Reference files can be found at: http://kepler.nasa.gov/images/3d/

The following software was used to create the printable files:
-Blender 2.77
-NetFabb Private 5.2
