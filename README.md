# Print your own Kepler Spacecraft 3D Puzzle!

Ever wanted to manufacture your own planet-finding spacecraft? Now you can!

Kepler is a space telescope launched by NASA in 2009 to determine the frequency of Earth-size planets in or near the habitable zone of other stars in our Galaxy.  It does this by searching for periodic dips in the brightness of stars, indicative of exoplanets transiting across their host stars, using a space telescope that is about 2.7 meters in diameter and 4.7 meters high. The telescope's main mirror is 0.95 meters in diameter.

## Print your own Kepler

With the help of the [NASA Ames SpaceShop Rapid Prototyping Facility](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/spaceshop/home), the Kepler office has created a 3D puzzle which you can print to build your own mini planet hunter!  The puzzle was created for educational purposes, and as such the model files were scaled and simplified for durability where appropriate. The results looks like this:
