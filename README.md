# Introduction

With the help of the [NASA Ames SpaceShop Rapid Prototyping Facility](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/spaceshop/home), the Kepler mission has created a 3D puzzle which you can print to build your own mini planet hunter.  The puzzle was created for educational purposes, and as such the model files were scaled and simplified for durability where appropriate.

## Components

Kepler is a space telescope launched by NASA in 2009 to determine the frequency of Earth-size planets in or near the habitable zone of other stars in our Galaxy.  It does this by searching for periodic dips in the brightness of stars, indicative of exoplanets transiting across their host stars, using a space telescope that is about 2.7 meters in diameter and 4.7 meters high. The telescope's main mirror is 0.95 meters in diameter.

The **photometer** hosts the telescope optics and the 84-CCD camera:

The **base** contains the electronics to control the spacecraft. The exterior has the antennae and reaction wheels attached to the side:

The **solar array** shields the photometer from sunlight and generates electricity for the spacecraft to operate:

The **sun-shade** keeps sunlight from entering into the telescope:

The **stand** allows the 3D-printed model to be displayed on a flat surface.  It is *not* an actual part of the spacecraft:

## Recommended print settings

You may achieve the best results using the following settings:
* Solid print density
* Soluble support structure
* Existing file orientation (printer varying)
